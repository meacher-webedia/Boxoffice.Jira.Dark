One day this might be turned into an official extension - until that day you can load it up with the following steps:

1. Download files from this repo into a folder on your computer.

## FireFox
2. Visit about:debugging
3. Choose This Firefox
4. Click on Load Temporary Add-on
5. Select the manifest.json within the extension's folder

```%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\{whatever your profile is called}\chrome\```

## Chrome
2. Visit chrome://extensions/
3. Click Load Unpacked
4. Select the extension's folder
